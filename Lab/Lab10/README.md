### Arrays

#### Ex1) Declaring, reading, printing arrays

#### Q1) Reverse (Lab 8.2)

Read an integer n from the user. Read n integers into an array. Print the array content in reverse order.
Assume n<50.

Modify your code to print only the odd numbers in reverse order.

#### Q2) Average and Variance (PS 11)

Read an integer n from the user. Read n integers into an array. Find the average of the numbers.
Assume n<50.

Then calculate the variance.

#### Q3) Encryption (Lab 8.1)

Write a program which reads a sentencefrom the user (read characters until '\n' appears).Your program then should putthis sentence into a char array(assume the sentence will be shorter than 50 characters). 

Then, encrypt this sentence byadding +1 to the value of each character.Then print the encrypted version to thescreen. 

Then decrypt this sentence by adding -1 toeach character, and print the decrypted versionagain to the screen.

#### Q4) Digits first

Read a sequence of characters (letters and digits) until user hits enter. First print the digits and then the characters in order of appearance.

### Additional problems on arrays

#### P1) Index of appearance (Lab 7.3)

Write a program which reads two integers: N and Mfrom the user. Then the program should readN more integers, then M more integers from theuser. Assume N<M<50. 

If the first combination of N integers appearat least once in the second combination of M integers,the program should write the starting index of th efirst appearance in the second combination. Otherwise it should not print anything.
