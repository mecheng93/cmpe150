### For Loops

#### Ex1) Printing line numbers

#### Q1) Compute the average of n numbers entered by the user where n is also specified by the user at the beginning of the program.

#### Q2)  Compute the factorial of given number n.

#### Q3) Write a program that controls whether the number entered by the user is perfect or not. 

Perfect number is the positive number whose sum of its positive divisors except itself is equal to itself. For example 6 and 28 are perfect numbers (6 = 1 + 2 + 3): 

### Break / Continue

#### Ex1) Reading integers from the user until -1 is entered

#### Ex2) Continue in for loops vs while loops

### Additional problems

#### P1) (Lab4.3) Write a program which reads a positive integer number N (smaller than 50), and prints the N'th Fibonacci number. 

Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1,1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, .... 
(Each number is sum of the previous twonumbers except the first two numbers 0 and 1which are predefined)

#### P2) (Lab 4.6) Write a program that takes 2 integers a and b, then prints the result of a^b (a*a*a...*a*a). 

#### P3) (Lab 4.7) Write a program that takes 2 integers and prints their greatest common divisor (GCD). 

#### P4) (Lab 4.8) Write a program that takes 2 integers and prints their greatest common divisor (GCD). 

#### P5) (Lab 4.9) Write a program that will take an integer N and print all the numbers that are divisible by either 2 or 3 from 1 to N (included). 
 
 - Assume N > 0 
 - Don't print numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3.
