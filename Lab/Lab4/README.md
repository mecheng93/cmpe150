### While Loops

#### Ex1) Printing line numbers

#### Ex2) Compute the average of numbers entered by the user. 

You must take the numbers until a negative value is entered:

#### Q1) (Lab 4.1) Odd digits 

Write a program which reads an integer (smaller than 1000000)then prints out how many of the digits are odd numbers. 

#### Q2) (Lab 4.4) Sum of evens

Write a program that will take integers as inputs until the user enters a negative number. Then shows the user the sum of all the non-negative numbers he/she entered.


### Additional Problems

#### P1) (PS 7.1) Count lowercase letters

Suppose the user enters the sequence of characters. Write a program that counts the lowercase letters in this sequence until * is met: 

#### P2) (PS 7.1) Read integer char-by-char.

You want to take a single integer from the user. Using %d for reading is not allowed: only %c is allowed. Input ends when a non-number character is entered.

#### P3) (Lab 4.10) Total digits and even digits

Write a program that takes a number and prints its total digit count and also even(Ã§ift) digit count. 

#### P4) (Lab 4.12) Average of even numbers

Write a program that will take integers until the user enters an odd number. Then print the average of the even numbers. 

 - Assume only positive numbers will be entered by the user.
