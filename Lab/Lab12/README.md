### Multidimensional Arrays

#### Q1) Matrix Operations

We have two two-dimensional matrices whose dimensions are 2x4.
Write a function for computing the sum of these two matrices. Write another function to compute the transpose of a give matrix

|INPUT| OUTPUT| 
|-----------|--------------|
|10 3 7 8 <br> 1 2 -1 4  <br> 1 0 3 4  <br> 3 2 9 8 | 11 3 10 12  <br> 4 4 8 12| 

#### Q2) Student grades and average

Read the number of students m and the number of courses n.

Read each student's grade from the user. Then user will enter
a student number (0...m-1) and you will print the student's 
average grade.

|Input|Output|
|-----------|--------------|
|3 4 <br>80 70 100 40 <br> 60 20 10 30 <br> 0 10 40 30<br>2 |Average of student 2: 20.00|


Modify your code and and read a course number from the user and
calculate and output that course's average and students who are above 
average.

|Input|Output|
|-----------|--------------|
|3 4 <br> 80 70 100 40<br> 60 20 10 30 <br> 0 10 40 30<br>1 |Course average: 33.33 <br> Students above average: 0|

### Strings

#### Ex1) String functions, reading and printing strings

#### Ex2) Length of a string (PS 13.1)

Calculate the length of a string

#### Q3) Copying strings (PS 13.1)

Write a function that copies a source string to the destination string. 
You can assume that (you should ensure that) destination string is large enough:

#### Q4) Compare strings

Write a function which returs 0  if two strings are same and -1 otherwise
