### If / Else if / Else / Switch

#### Ex1) Read the grade of the student. Then, if the grade of the student is greater than or equal to 60, print "You passed"

#### Ex2) Write a program that readsthe grade (0-100) of a student, and prints the letter grade.

- "A" if it is greater than or equal to 90, 
- "B" if its between 90 - 80, 
- "C" if its between 80 - 60, 
- "D" if its between 60 - 40,
- "F" otherwise. 

#### Ex3) Program reading a month and printing the days in that month using switch.

#### Q1) Convert time

Write a program that converts the time, which is given in seconds, to hh:mm:ss format.

Note: If a value is smaller than 10, you must print 0 next to it. 
           i.e.: 9:3:45 is invalid, it must be 09:03:45 
           
#### Q2) Write aprogram that reads the distance (km) between two cities: A and B, the speedof a vehicle (km/h), and some travel time (hours). Starting fromA to B, your program should calculate the status of thetravel at given time.If the car can reach the destination (B) within the given time, theprogram should print: "The vehicle has arrived X hours ago"(X must be calculated). 

If the car can not reach the destination in the given time, the program will printeither 
     "The journey continues, the car is closer to A" 
or
     "The journey continues, the car is closer to B" 
according to the position of the car in the road.

#### Q3) Calculator 	

Write a basic calculator program (+, -, *, /) with if-else statements. 

The program takes three inputs: float, char, float, then prints the result. 

|INPUT|OUTPUT|
|-----|------|
1 + 45| 46.00 
1 - 45| -44.00 
1 * 45| 45.00 
1 / 45| 0.02 

#### Q4) Sorting numbers

#### P1) (Lab 3.5)	Divisible

Write a program that will take 2 numbers from the user and if the first number is divisible by the second number, your code should print "it is divisible", 
if it is not divisible, then print "it is not divisible". If one of your numbers is nonpositive, print "Incorrect input" 

#### P2 (PS 6.3) Case conversion
