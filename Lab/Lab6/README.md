### Nested loops

#### Ex1) Drawing rectangles, squares

#### Ex2) Drawing square with indices

<pre>
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4)
</pre>



#### Q1) Take an integer n from the user and draw the following triangles of height n.

<pre>
n=2
*
**

n=3
*
**
***

n=4
*
**
***
****

n=5
*
**
***
****
*****

#### Q2) Take an integer n from the user and draw the following triangles of height n.

<pre>
n=2

#### Q4) Write a program that reads an integer value, and computes the sum of the factorial of each digit . 

The output will be an integer . For example, assume that the user enters "572" as the input integer. For each digit of the integer, you will compute the factorial. Then you will compute the sum of these factorials: 5! + 7! + 2! = 120 + 5040 + 2 = 5162. 

### Additional problems

#### P1) (Lab 4.2) Write a program which reads two integersN and M (both smaller than 15, greater than 1)then prints a rectangle with size NxM which has stars at borders, and lines inside.

#### P2) Take an integer n from the user and draw the following diamond shape
