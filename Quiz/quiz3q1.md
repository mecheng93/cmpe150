## Question

Write a program which reads characters until the user enters a digit. After reading each character your program should check if it's a lower-case letter. If so print its upper-case version. Any other characters should be printed unchanged. Any digit should stop printing and also terminate your program.

Assume: The input will be one line and will include at least one digit.
